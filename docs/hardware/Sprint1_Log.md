## 1) Confirm Final Hardware Selection

Following the systems and sofware leads, the MicroROS - Pi5 Robot Car was chosen as the base architecture for our Smart Car Project.

It uses the ROS operating system main point given from Sofware lead, to make this project feasible.

In its base configuration it has a Lidar sensor, a 2k camera, 4 servo motors with encoder, and a 6 axis IMU chip, this follows the requirements given by the systems lead.
 
In order to have redundance on our sensing capabilities, we will add infrared sensor for line detection, and ultrasound sensor for obstacle detection.

Mounting hardware must be designed for the redundance sensors as the curren body and chassi, has no place for them.

## 2) Perform Independent "Hello World"

Test for the ultrasound senor were done, being able to measure distance and detect objects infront of the sensor.

Test for the infrared sensor was conducted in order to see the funtionally with diferent light conditions as well as the effective range.

Tests on the included sensors on the MicroROS - Pi5 Robot car (Lidar, camera, motors and encoder) will be carry out on the next sprint.


## 3) Validate Motor Driver and Sensor Interfaces

This will be conducted during the next sprint.
