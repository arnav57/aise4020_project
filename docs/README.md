## Documentation

Documentation is organized as follows. 

1. Each team lead has their own folders to add whatever they feel relevant, this includes individual logs per sprint.
1. The sprint plan is included here as a pdf, and the overall sprint review will be placed under `./sprints/sprintX/SprintX_Review.md`.
